  'Fish mortality is a natural occurrence that can happen when cultivating a fish farm. It is undeniable that fish deaths transpire now and then. Problems that contribute to fish mortality include weather that causes oxygen depletion, fish disease, as well as dead fish/es itself, among other things. These dead fishes, if not retrieved and left to rot, pose an even greater threat within a farm, especially when these carcasses sink instead of floating. If cultivators aren\'t careful enough, these rotting fish may release harmful chemicals that can contaminate the fishpond\'s water and compromise other healthy fishes. An interview was conducted among fish farmers in Matina Aplaya to find out how they address such issues. Collectively, they responded by having scheduled underwater checking for dead fish that sank at the bottom of the pond, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Hence, the proponents developed a system, FINnish Na, to reduce and address this specific fish farmer problem. Primarily using an ultrasonic sensor placed at the bottom of a basin, the proponents have simulated a miniature fishpond. When the sensor detects the presence of dead fish in the pond, the system will notify fish farmers through a notification in the app. The app can also provide the mortality rate of the fish and gives a daily and monthly report of the number of dead fish that the fish farm has so far. After testing the system for four (4) days, split between two pond conditions: with live fish and without, the proponents made comparisons of each day\'s result. It was evident that there was variability among the results. Significantly, however, there is a slight inconsistency of sensor readings when live fishes are present and if they are constantly moving. Based on the results of this study, the proponents recommend that an advanced type of ultrasonic sensor is utilized, as well as improve the sensor detection function, where constant interferences such as fish movement are ignored.',

  'Two of the most common sources of distractions inside the classroom include noise and uncontrollable use of technology, specifically mobile devices, among students. Studies have shown that noise has a direct negative effect on student learning with language and reading development particularly affected. Moreover, technology is one of the factors which negatively affects the learning process of the students. The usage of mobile phones causes disturbance in the classroom affecting academic performances. However, due to the proliferating use of technology in classrooms, the researchers used this opportunity to utilize rather than restrict the students in using mobile devices as an effective tool for learning. Heeder is a mobile VOIP-enabled and hybrid voice distribution application that aims to provide an alternative tool for classroom instruction delivery. The purpose of this study was to provide convenience to learners who are easily distracted caused by noise and extensive use of mobile devices. Through the said application, teachers and students had the opportunity to better communicate with each other. The application established connections within users through creating channels, broadcasts real-time voice data, and monitors student users on the teachers\' side. Dynamic Systems Development Method was used to allow the researchers to create the application which requires flexible requirements in early phases. Upon fulfillment of this project, the proponents were able to develop a hybrid mobile application using Cordova framework that provides a tool for students in promoting learning through intent listening. For obvious reasons, network speed has an impact on the voice data quality of the application. Thus, the proponents have recommended creating an API that would not require the use of the internet for the reliability of voice data and localize the use of the application inside the campus. However, the application did not guarantee a total noise-free environment rather it enhanced the voice; thus, studies must consider eliminating the unpleasant noise especially in classroom settings.',

  'Asthma is a lifetime chronic disease taking off to anomalous lung functions and difficulty in breathing. Asthma influences more than 300 million individuals around the world. Asthmatic patients have trouble breathing and airflow obstruction caused by inflammation and constriction of the airways. Home monitoring of lung function is the preferred course of action to give physicians and asthma patients a chance to control the disease jointly. Thus, it is important to develop accurate and efficient asthma monitoring devices that are easy for patients to use. \n\nObserving on our own is the preliminary course of action to monitor, treat, and control chronic disease. Self-checking mutually causes doctors and patients to have authority over ongoing observing and to give on-time treatment. A classical spirometry test is currently the preeminent way to diagnose the severity of lung functions and their response to treatment, but it requires supervision. Currently, portable devices are available to monitor Peak Expiratory Flow, but it is expensive and inconvenient to use. \n\nPrediction of severe exacerbation triggered by uncontrolled asthma is highly important for patients suffering from asthma, as avoiding maleficent symptoms that could need special treatment or even hospitalization, can protect patients from the aftereffects of bronchodilation. As of late, there has been an increased use of wireless sensor networks and embedded systems in the medical sector. Healthcare providers are now attempting to use these devices to monitor patients in a more accurate and automated way. This would permit healthcare providers to have up-to-date patient information without physical interaction, allowing for more accurate diagnoses and better treatment. \n\nIn this study, we present work in progress on an application scenario where a smartphone is used to detect and quantitatively index early signs of asthma attack triggers. Here, the embedded microphone in the smartphone records the user\'s breath sound while motion-sensor-heart rate changes. \n\nThis will overcome the shortcomings of the existing system by home monitoring the lung functions and patient\'s environmental parameters over time without any supervision as in standard spirometry tests. Our design and results show that using only built-in sensors in smartphones, mobile phones can sufficiently and reliably monitor the health status of patients with long-term respiratory conditions such as asthma.',

  'One type of learning disability caused by a neurological disorder is dyslexia and the lack of intervention for dyslexic students is one of the major reasons why learners are frequently neglected and judged in society particularly by their peers. The importance of early intervention is vital. Although kids indeed learn in different ways and at different rates, it seems individuals with dyslexia are pretty much bom with special conditions in their brains. The earlier they receive an intervention, the higher the chance they may become better at learning words and reading. LearnDys was developed to help solve the problem of a lack of early intervention. The researchers designed and developed an educational learning application that provides cognitive and psychomotor activities intended for ages 3 to 6. The specific activities given by the application are only helpful for children with this condition. To achieve this, the researchers used the R.A.S.E. Model based on what is considered essential for ensuring quality in learning by using mobile applications to enhance the learning ability and ensure the entire achievement of the learning outcome. Based on the activities given, cognitive and psychomotor is part of the learning objective. Cognitive as the most common domain in learning that deals with the intellectual side, and psychomotor as a domain that focuses on motor skills and action requires physical coordination. The objective serves to complete and achieve the project and ensure that all the features must be present in the application.

  'Year over year, communication tools such as social media are highly targeted by cybercriminals. Their schemes include the distribution of malicious URLs. A malicious URL is a URL that facilitates scams, frauds, and a cyberattack. By clicking on a malicious URL, a person can automatically download a malware program or a virus that can take over their devices or trick them into disclosing sensitive information on a fake website. End users who lack a fundamental understanding of information security are easier to be exploited by cybercriminals. One of the solutions for this kind of problem is using blocklist lookup; though effective, blocklists have a significant false-negative rate and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. To address this problem, the researchers developed a mobile application called Mal Where, which can detect website links from image data. MalWhere also utilizes and combines the two known URL classification approaches: blocklisting and machine learning. With the blocklist service, MalWhere has access to a large number of Malicious URLs around the world. With machine learning, MalWhere can predict the classification of a URL, whether it is benign or malicious. The classification model was trained using 39 features and a supervised machine learning classifier called XGBoost. The classification ability of the model is mainly used to classify unknown and benign URLs to the blocklist service. Based on the conducted testing, MalWhere has an 88% accuracy rate in predicting the classification of a URL-whether it is benign or malicious.',

  'Stress is generally experienced in our daily lives. It is also inescapable. Stress is a response to a particular event or situation. It is the way that our body prepares to face difficult situations which require focus, strength, and heightened alertness. If an individual experiences stress, the body will react to respond to the causes or factors of stress. The body responds through sweat glands which produce electrical flow (conductance) and pulse rate as well. In this paper, a device was developed to be able to determine the stress level of an individual, particularly for the tertiary students at the University of Southeastern Philippines. Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) detects strong emotions and electrical flow through the skin and the pulse sensor detects the fluctuation of the blood pumped by the human heart (beats-per-minute/BMP). The gathered data will be interpreted to its corresponding level based on the stress parameters and will provide the final stress level output based on the table formulated from the fuzzy logic method. The testing was conducted alongside the ten (10) respondents; five (5) male and five (5) female students at the said university and their final stress level was displayed through the serial monitor of Arduino.',

The research aimed to design and develop an improved smart fish pond monitoring system for milkfish farming. It will notify the farmers whenever the water temperature or dissolved oxygen levels change. The system was designed to monitor pond water using temperature and dissolved oxygen level sensors. Sensors send pre-processed data to a server through the built-in WIFI module of the microcontroller. The mobile application generates significant pond parameters to generate significant parameters and activates actuators to maintain water temperature. The researchers used the Rapid Application Development (RAD) methodology as the development model to keep track of progress and give real-time updates on any problems or modifications that emerge. The devices used in this research were two sensors, three actuators, a mobile application, and a server. The testing process includes using pre-processed data that was sent to a local server. The server analyzes water temperature and dissolved oxygen levels. The app then displays the data in various places of the app once it has been processed. It also includes a series of conditional statements to identify the pond\'s state. The sensors detect changes in water temperature and alert the owner or caretaker by sending push notifications about temperature fluctuations after gathering and processing the data. It uses a microcontroller to analyze a sequence of conditional statements before activating the specific actuators. The study concluded that the microcontroller generated important parameters and data logs that indicated the pond and fish condition. A push notification was sent to the smartphone, informing it of the current state of the pond in real-time.

With this method of reading, translating the braille symbols demands much time to be exerted to find out the right transcription. In addition to this, due to the fact that Braille has two levels, the capacity of an individual to memorize and remember all of the braille symbols cell translation for each letter and word is another factor to consider. This project focuses on creating a mobile application that helps the teachers in translating both Uncontracted and Contracted braille symbol into ABC text by just capturing the document with a cell then immediately provides the correct translation. The application offers a translation for two different languages: English and Filipino. Furthermore, this application has an online database that enables it to store a large number of data that can hold all of the translation of each braille symbol cells in two languages and two levels of braille. Trials and errors had occurred multiple times during the development of the project. One limitation of the developed application is its sensitivity to light, that is, if the camera and the document that will be captured is not placed in a well-lit area and the shadowing were not properly checked, then the accuracy rate of the translation will not be as high as it is expected. In addition to this, the application captures the cells one- by-one for a reason that in capturing the whole document affects the proper alignment of the cells towards the camera. The farther the cells are from the camera lens, the distorted they become, which results to erroneous translation.

  'In rice farming, the reason why farmers apply much fertilizer to their yields is to further grow and develop their plants, swiftly. Thus, nitrogen fertilizer is considered to be the primary source of yield-limiting nutrients in rice production. As this limits the production of rice whenever farmers input a lot of N release in the field. Farmers employed the use of LCC and its instructions to ease the use of nitrogen in the field, without even sacrificing their yield in order to know nitrogen requirement in real-time management. Despite its widespread use in agricultural research institutes, farmers were still unfamiliar with this tool. Technology researchers stressed the need for more significant research on the Leaf Color Chart, which enables the need for more computer science and technology research and the digitization of agricultural science. Farmers could still make mistakes when comparing the plant\'s leaf color with the LCC; but, errors are still possible. Therefore, various farmers claimed that they are more likely to adopt the technology. If technology is presented to them, there is a need to further explain on how they will be able to utilize it. The LAON application was designed to automate the IRRI and PhilRice\'s Leaf Color Chart. Farmers typically gather ten photos of uniform rice leaf sizes from the chosen field. The nitrogen content of the rice plant will be determined by assessing and comparing the sample images of rice leaves. Furthermore, weather forecasting is launching in response to the application.

This project is concerned with developing a faster illegal electrical connection detection technology to strengthen information security in the subject matter and prevent its physical consequences. With the Internet-of-Things, this project involves the development of an IoT-enabled electricity meter with an illegal electrical connection detection feature that allows a user to monitor consumption remotely. A residential miniature with simulated theft initiation was developed to test the project''s effectiveness in reaching the goal. Comparative current data method was utilized to identify theft, and fundamentals of electricity consumption computing were utilized to monitor usage. System outputs were shown on the mobile application, including a theft detection report and real-time graphical representations of electrical consumption.',

  'Programming is challenging for novices. Hence, it is important that help must be provided once the students get discouraged. The lack of intervention from the teacher is one of the reasons why students choose to disengage from their programming task and eventually drop out from the course. It is for this reason that the proponents aimed to develop a programming tool that collects data every 10 minutes and after an hour detects student frustration and boredom in real-time, where teachers can be given a cue when to provide immediate feedback to the students. Keystrokes and mouse movements are collected and analyzed as studies have shown that student affect can be reflected from them. The Circumplex model was used as the framework to determine which quadrant of arousal and valence does boredom and frustration belong to. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, no actual student testers were gathered so the proponents were left with no actual data to run the model. Instead, a proposed framework was used to determine whether the keystroke combinations, mouse behaviors, and other activities tantamount to boredom or frustration. A user interface was designed for teachers where they can monitor the student keyboard and mouse activities. The interface includes a display that indicates if the student needs to be monitored or if the student needs help already as indicated by his/her boredom and frustration levels. To acquire valid results, it is recommended that the experiment is conducted in actual programming laboratory settings. The system can be installed on the students'' computers and be run in the background as they work on their programming tasks. The teacher''s module can be installed in the teacher''s computer so that they can completely monitor their student activities. It is also recommended that camera devices be installed as well as correctly validating the effect experienced by the students.',

Climatic data are extracted under near-current periods (1970-2000), 2030s (2020-2049), and 2050s (2040-2069), and changes in cacao suitability were assessed using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling approach. The best model indicated that the land index for cacao suitability is between 49.51 to 79.31 for near-current; 48.36 to 75.86 for 2030s and 48.00 to 74.34 for 2050s. This categorizes the suitability class of cacao into marginally suitable (S3) to highly suitable (S1) for the near-current and 2030s periods while dropping to only marginally suitable (S3) to moderately suitable (S2) by 2050s. Specifically, across the high suitability (S1) areas in the Philippines, there is a projected decrease from 65,853 km2 (near-current) to 31,357 km2 by 2030s and 23,458 km2 by 2050s; a change by -9.84% and -12.1% for the future periods, respectively. Regions of Luzon (excluding Palawan), Palawan, Visayas, Western Mindanao, and Southern Mindanao will experience a decrease in its S1 areas which is primarily attributed to the projected increase in mean and max temperature and rainfall variability in the future. The most pronounced change is measured in Western Mindanao with -84.26% followed by Luzon with -80.18% by 2050s. Moreover, the results indicated that ANN approach was able to perform cacao suitability prediction with satisfactory results of a Mean Square Error (MSE) of 3.74e-6 and correlation of determination of 0.99981414.',

  'The problem of motorcycle theft has been never-ending and is regarded as a property crime with one of the highest occurrences, primarily due to characteristics that make motorcycles easy to steal. Many methods have been introduced, yet they have proven insufficient to prevent motorcycle theft. Therefore, the proponents seized this opportunity to propose a study and develop the SNAPDRIVE device and mobile application. SNAPDRIVE consists of two main components: hardware and software. The hardware component includes various peripherals, such as a camera, all attached to a Raspberry Pi, which serves as the central processing unit. By detecting motion, the system activates and begins facial detection using Haar Cascade. Once a blink is detected via Eye Blink Detection using Facial Landmark, an image is captured and undergoes facial recognition using Sparse Local Binary Pattern Histogram. If the face is recognized, the motorcycle is enabled. Otherwise, the owner is notified of the attempt through the software component, a mobile application linked to the device in real time. The mobile application serves as a dynamic and vital tool for inputting and viewing relevant data, as well as receiving notifications transmitted through a cloud server. However, for testing purposes, the proponents used a DC motor instead of an actual motorcycle. The purpose of this system is to provide both proactive and reactive measures to prevent motorcycle theft. With such a system in place to secure the motorcycle from being enabled, it will help deter thieves from pursuing the criminal act. Additionally, this research aligns with the government''s efforts to reduce criminality. The proponents employed the Waterfall methodology in the development of SNAPDRIVE, as this project required a sequential process to accomplish.

With a wide variety of products available online, retrieving relevant and appropriate products from a database has become a challenge. This issue can be addressed through a technique called semantic searching, a data retrieval method that considers the meaning of words, substance, context, intent, and concept of the query. In this study, the researchers aimed to develop a semantic search engine, apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to improve product searching, and deploy the search engine over the Internet. The Amazon dataset was used in the study, preprocessed, and loaded into the Elasticsearch database, where users could conduct semantic searches. Flask was used to create a web application, while Ngrok was utilized to deploy the application online. Fifteen respondents from various universities participated in testing the semantic search engine and completed a survey. Each respondent performed five semantic search queries and counted the false positives in the search results. Upon testing and evaluation, the search engine achieved an accuracy of 87.3%. The study identified inadequate product titles and product categorization issues as primary causes of high false positive counts for certain search queries. Additionally, the lack of product images may have influenced respondents'' perceptions of the relevance of search results. For future research, the researchers suggested refining product categorization by incorporating additional NLP techniques, such as ontologies, and exploring Machine Learning Classification to further enhance search accuracy.',

To address this issue, boxers must enhance their performance and gain enough popularity to attract investments from private organizations. As a solution, this study aimed to assist boxers and coaches by developing a model that helps create optimal training plans through historical data analysis. By analyzing both the boxer and their opponents, the model predicts match outcomes and winning conditions using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and identifies boxing styles through the K-means clustering algorithm. The prediction models demonstrated strong performance despite an unbalanced and incomplete dataset from CompuBox. The fine-tuned models achieved 97% accuracy in predicting winning conditions and an 88% F1-score for match outcomes. For validation, the model attained 90% accuracy in predicting winning conditions and a 69% F1-score for match outcomes. Among 173 data points, the clustering model identified 55 boxers and their respective styles. The results revealed that boxers use a variety of styles throughout their careers. The study categorized boxing styles into Swarmer, Slugger, and Outboxer. These findings provide coaches with valuable insights into their boxers'' aptitude and style, enabling them to strategically plan and develop winning tactics.

  'Fisheries are exposed to anthropogenic risks, oceanic destruction, and various weather changes, making the process of locating fish shoals time-consuming and resource-intensive. This results in high costs, low profits for fishermen, and adverse effects on their socio-economic status. Hence, researchers were encouraged to adopt machine learning in detecting Potential Fishing Zones (PFZs). This study aimed to develop a predictive model for detecting PFZs by analyzing various sea features as potential predictors, forecasting probable fish catch quantity, and identifying seasonal fish catch behavior patterns along with visual representations. The study employed a feature importance function to determine the significance of different predictors, and classification machine learning algorithms were used to construct the models. Secondary data from India were utilized for training, while data from the Visayan Sea, Philippines, were used for testing the models. The researchers applied the ARIMA model to forecast probable fish catch quantity, seasonal variations, and trends. According to the feature importance scores, Salinity and Sea Chlorophyll were identified as the most significant sea features, with optimal threshold values of 32.6 parts per thousand (ppt) and 0.18 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m3), respectively. Among the machine learning models, Random Forest demonstrated the highest accuracy score of 80.56% in predicting PFZs. The ARIMA model parameters were set to p = 5, d = 0, and q = 4, as this configuration resulted in the lowest AIC value of 1458.217, making it the best fit for forecasting. The ARIMA model successfully forecasted probable fish catch quantities on a quarterly basis for the years 2021–2026, highlighting the seasonality and trend of fish catch. The study''s findings can contribute to improving fishing methods and resource management. However, the forecasted fish catch exhibited a declining trend over time due to potential sources of uncertainty. Despite this limitation, the researchers successfully met their objectives of detecting PFZs, forecasting probable fish catch, identifying seasonal trends, and providing valuable insights for the fishing community.',

   'Over the course of recent decades, the aquaculture industry has been growing at an exponential rate with their annual production. The overly increasing growth in human population has also increased the demand for consumption of aquatic products. As a result, several countries have resorted to aquaculture to meet their aquatic product needs. Fish just like any other animals have such specific physical and chemical needs that if these needs aren''t supplied, the animals become stressed, and their health and survival are threatened. Water quality is composed of different components such as temperature and pH level and sudden changes on these variables proves to cause stress to fishes, can slow their growth, delay their reproduction and in the worst case scenario can cause death. A comprehensive study of the effects of stress in aquaculture management is crucial to grasp how it can result in reduced yield and subsequent financial loss. This study aims to know the condition of the aquacultured environment by determining the quality of water where the fishes are living. The researchers in this study developed three models that determined if the water quality is fitting for the aquacultured fish using SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree algorithm. The dataset was split by 70/30 and all the models were fine tuned using gridsearchCV for the model to have the best parameter for training. The DT performed best with a 98.17% accuracy and F-Score of 98%, while SVM placed second with a 82.83% accuracy and F-Score of 69% and the K-NN model had he worst performance among the three with a 76.66% accuracy and F-Score of 62%.

   'In the Philippines, breast cancer holds the distinction of being the most prevalent cancer among women [92]. As per data from the PSA and the Department of Health, roughly 3% of Filipino women are likely to receive a breast cancer diagnosis during their lifetime. Remarkably, in February 2017, the Philippine Obstetrical and Gynecological Society reported the highest incidence of breast cancer in the Philippines among 197 countries [95]. Mammography has proven effective in identifying even early-stage breast cancers [3], making annual screenings crucial, particularly for women over 40. However, the accuracy of mammograms can be compromised due to variations in breast tissue, occasionally leading to false- negative results [94]. Consequently, monthly self-examinations remain vital. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can enhance the diagnostic precision of mammograms. The ability of AI to process and interpret complex patterns in imaging data makes it a powerful tool for detecting subtle abnormalities often missed in manual screenings [96]. AI''s potential to reduce false negatives could significantly improve early breast cancer detection, complementing mammography and monthly self-examinations, thereby improving prognosis and survival rates. This study attempted to construct a novel hybrid model that segments cancerous cells in breast mammogram images. The researchers exhausted all the resources and searched all research databases and concluded this approach is novel as of this writing. The proposed hybrid model, substituting Resnet 152 on the Encoder block of Nested Unet (Unet++) model, was implemented. Intersection Over Union, DICE, and Binary Cross Entropy with Logits loss are used as indicators to measure the segmentation performance of the model. Custom Pre-Processing, Data Augmentation, Hyperparameters, and Fine Tuning was utilized in the study. The researchers achieved an accuracy as high as 95% with a mean and median detection score of IOU (67.57%) and DICE (68.40%), experimental results showed that the proposed model did great with limited dataset and did not overfit or underfit according to Koehrsen [85]. In future work, the researchers recommend the following: adding more high-quality Data of Mammogram Images with Verified Pathological Ground Truth Masks could be used. To further improve the IOU and DICE scores of the model, a more thorough tweaking plus experiments should be conducted of the hyperparameters or Fine tuning to see what the best practices for this type of problem is. Try using more simpler Data Augmentation Techniques and experiment if it will achieve higher segmentation accuracy without the risk of Overfitting. Not every photo will behave properly for the model. Different DICE or IoU scores tell the researchers that every image has a different degree of variability and could impact on how well the model performs. The researchers recognize these outliers and ascertain the reason for them. Are they the result of inadequate annotation, or does the model struggle with specific types of images?

Four (4) of the respondents were from the Master of Education Program, and the eleven (11) were from the Doctor of Education Program. Given the library''s policy of ten percent (10%) accessibility of the work for online and electronic copies of theses and dissertations gives the user the rights and balances copyright and fair use. In contrast, some respondents are not in favor and are not satisfied with having a limited portion of materials accessible since the materials are available in the library. On the other hand, all respondents clearly and concisely understand how copyright and Fair Use works based on the ideal concept and definition of copyright and fair use from an international governing organization for intellectual property. They thought that the nature of almost all theses and dissertations were published, therefore, should be highly accessible to the library user. Lastly, significant factors of accessing the unpublished resources in the library are solely for academic, scholarly, and commercial purposes. The study concludes that Participants awareness of the intellectual property of unpublished materials was considerable assenting to the relevance of both fair use and copyright policy concepts.',

	'Nowadays, days are part of the growing technological advance wherein online resources can be found and easily accessed by the users. Enhance services using different kinds of monitoring and online user surveys that can be used to gather data quickly. Collection mapping tools are only one of the assessment tools that can be evaluated. The collection provides reports that could help the librarian\'s decision-making regarding the acquisition of books, curriculum book re-alignment, and curriculum collection balance. The general purpose of this study is to develop c-map analytics: a web-based application of collection mapping for the university of Immaculate Conception learning resource center graduate school library. The graduate school library is struggling in terms of conducting collection mapping, several problems are encountered during the traditional way of doing the process. Lack of human resource to focus on doing the assessment, time-consuming in which it takes much more time to finish the process and lastly the University is undergoing PAASCU accreditation this year including the graduate school library with corresponding recommendation to conduct library collection mapping. Through the c-map analytics system, the processes are already automated and integrated the extracted data file from the existing library management system and provide seamless data interaction and report visualization by generating reports on data analytics visualization, remarks, and collection figures. The study was anchored to the development of IFLA conspectus method of conducting collection assessment using conspectus level of collection. The researcher also recommends innovating and upgrading into higher development in which the user can used the system in online and offline mode status, adopting the data mining process for advance gathering of data and unique features.', NULL, NULL);
